            The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro or University of Brazil (Portuguese: Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ or Universidade do Brasil) is a public university in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. UFRJ is the largest federal university in the country and is one of the Brazilian centers of excellence in teaching and research. In terms of scientific, artistic and cultural productions it is recognized nationally and internationally due to the great teachers, researchers, reviews and assessments made by international agencies. In 2015 QS World University Rankings ranked UFRJ as the best Brazilian federal university, as well as the third best university in the country occupying the ninth position among institutions of Latin America. In 2015 the Ranking Universitário Folha (RUF) ranked UFRJ as the second best university in Brazil and the best Federal University in the country.
            <br>
            <br>
            Brazil's first official higher education institution, it has operated continuously since 1792, when the "Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho" (Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, precursor to the university's current Polytechnic School) was founded, and served as basis for the country's college system since its officialization in 1920. Besides its 157 undergraduate and 580 postgraduate courses, the UFRJ is responsible for seven museums, most notably the National Museum, nine hospitals, hundreds of laboratories and research facilities and forty-three libraries. Its history and identity are closely tied to the Brazilian ambitions of forging a modern, competitive and just society.
            <br>
            <br>
            The university is located mainly in Rio de Janeiro, with ramifications spreading to other ten cities. Its main campuses are the historical campus of "Praia Vermelha" (Red Beach) and the newer "Cidade Universitária" (College City), which houses the "Parque Tecnológico do Rio" (Technology Park of Rio) - a science, technology and innovation development cluster. There are also several off-campus units scattered in Rio de Janeiro: the School of Music, the College of Law Studies, the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences and the Institute of History, in downtown Rio; the National Museum and the Valongo Observatory in São Cristóvão; and the high-school unit "Colégio de Aplicação" (Application College) in Lagoa. To the city of Macaé, located in the State's northern region, was dedicated a research and learning center focused on environmental issues and oil-related matters, and the city of Duque de Caxias, in partnership with the National Institute of Metrics, Normalization and Industrial Quality (Inmetro), saw the implementation of "Pólo Avançado de Xerém" (Advanced Center of Xerém), aimed at boosting research in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology.

            <br>
            UFRJ is one of the main culprits in the formation of the Brazilian intellectual elite, contributing significantly to build not only the history of Rio de Janeiro but also of Brazil. Some of its former students include renowned economists Carlos Lessa and Mario Henrique Simonsen; Minister Marco Aurélio Mello; the architect Oscar Niemeyer; the educator Anísio Teixeira; the engineer Benjamin Constant Botelho; writers Clarice Lispector, Jorge Amado and Vinicius de Moraes; politicians Francisco Pereira Passos, Osvaldo Aranha and Pedro Calmon, besides the great physicians Carlos Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz and Vital Brazil.

            COPPE (Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Post-Graduation and Research in Engineering) is UFRJ's supplementary organ. Founded in 1963 by The engineer Alberto Luiz Coimbra, the institution made it possible to create graduate courses in Brazil. Over the course of the last five decades it has become the nost important center for engineering research and education in Latin America. The  academic  output  reflects  its  standard  of  excellence.  About  200  doctoral  degrees  and  300  master’s degrees  are  awarded  annually.  COPPE  researchers publish about 2,000 scientific papers in national and international journals and conferences annually. It has already awarded more than 12,000 master’s and doctoral degrees in its 12 graduate master’s and doctoral courses. Presently, the institution has 348 faculty members, 2,729 students and 350 employees. 
            <br>
            <br>
            COPPE also has 123 modern laboratories, which together constitute the country’s largest engineering laboratory complex. Based on three distinguishing features – academic excellence; full-time faculty members and students, and commitment to society – COPPE has distinguished itself through its work to increase understanding and produce highly qualified professionals and innovative teaching methods; thereby serving as a model for other universities and research institutes across the country. 
            <br>
            <br>
            COPPE is also notable for owning the world's largest (volume terms) and deepest oceanic tank, which is used to simulate sea conditions. LabOceano is able to reproduce the main features of the marine environment and simulate phenomena occurring in water deeper than 2000 meters. LabOceano is a strategic technological support for Brazil, which has more than 90% of its oil reserves at sea, and for the oil and shipping industries.
